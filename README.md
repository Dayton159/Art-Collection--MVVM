# Art-Collection--MVVM
 This is my Nano Challenge 3 Project to create a simple app build based on a Design Pattern structure. 
 Art-Collection--MVVM is an app that displays a list of classical art painted by some famous artist that also provide some details about the painting.
 I build this app using MVVM Design Pattern, data binding using Observable, and of course networking to fetch the data.
 
 ## Background & Story
 This app is inspired from my curiousity about classical painting artworks. I have been really into a classical art since I was young.
 I found those arts are unique and being really interested on it, but at the same time it also triggers my curiosity to find out more about 
 the meaning behind those artworks and what kind of person the artist are. So, building this app has been a lot of fun to me since I can keep learning
 and improve myself technically but also enjoying the process by looking on the result of what I have achieved so far. 
 
 ## How to Run 
 * Download the app or just simple clone the project
 * You can run the app either on a physical device or a simulator with iOS 13 and above.
